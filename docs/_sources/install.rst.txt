============

Python
------

To install the package, follow these steps:

1. First, download and install the latest version of Python 3.11 from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Once you have installed Python 3.11, open a command prompt or terminal window.

3. Right-click on "Command Prompt" and select "Run as administrator".

::

    setx PATH "%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311;%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\Scripts;%PATH%" /M

This will add the Python 3.11 installation directory to the system path variable.

4. Close the Command Prompt and open a new one to ensure that the changes take effect.
5. Check if Python is installed correctly by typing the following command:
