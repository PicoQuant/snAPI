# main class
class snAPI:
    """
This is the main class of the snAPI library. When creating the snAPI object the api is initialized.
Here you have to select the underlying library and therefore the device family you want to work with.
It holds the underlying device dll (dynamic link library), the :obj:`snAPI.deviceConfig`, the measurement classes
and many other API calls. 

Note
----
Creating the snAPI object calls :meth:`initAPI`. Please look there for detailed information.

Parameters
----------
    systemIni: str
        | path to the system.ini file (default: "system.ini")
    libType: LibType (default: LibType.MH)

Returns
-------
    the snAPI object

Example
-------

::

    # This instantiates a snAPI object in sn for TimeHarp260 
    sn = snAPI(libType=LibType.TH260)
        
    """
    dll = ct.WinDLL(os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '.\snAPI64.dll')))
    """
the snAPI.dll

    """

    deviceIDs = [] 
    """
This list contains the IDs serial numbers of the connected devices or the file names of
the opened file devices (files that act as devices) and will be filled after calling :meth:`getDeviceIDs()`.

    """

    deviceConfig = ()
    """
The device config contains all information about the initialized device. To update it it is necessary to call :meth:`getDeviceConfig`.

Note
----
The deviceConfig can not directly written. It is only for checking the current state. To change the configuration, you have to call
the device functions or write the config with :meth:`loadIniConfig` or :meth:`setIniConfig`.
For detailed information read :ref:`configuration`!

This setting is normally not required but it can be useful when data rates are very low and the overflows is high compared to the number of
photons. If used the hardware will count overflows and only transfer them to the FiFo when the holdtime has elapsed. The default
value is 2 ms. If you are implementing a real-time preview and data rates are very low you may observe “stutter” when the
holdtime is too large because then there is nothing no readout of the FiFo for these long times. This is
aggravated by the fact that the FiFo has a transfer granularity of 16 records. Supposing a data stream without any
regular event records (i.e. only overflows) this means that effectively there will be a transfer only every 16*holdtime ms.
Whenever there is a true event record arriving (photons or markers) the previously accumulated overflows will instantly
be transferred. This is the case even with dark counts from the detector. Hence, the stutter will rarely occur. In any case you can
switch overflow compression off by setting the holdtime to zero (0).

class Filter():
    """
Filtering the TTTR data stream before transfer helps to reduce the USB bus load in TTTR mode by eliminating photon events
that carry no information of interest as typically found in many coincidence correlation experiments. 
There are two types of event filters. The Row Filters are implemented in the local FPGA processing a row of
input channels. Each Row Filter can act only on the input channels within its own row and never on the sync
channel. The Main Filter is implemented in the main FPGA processing the aggregated events arriving from
the row FPGAs. The Main Filter can therefore act on all channels of the device including the sync
channel. Since the Row Filters and Main Filter form a daisychain, the overall filtering result depends on their
combined action. Both filters are by default disabled upon device initialization and can be independently enabled
when needed.

Both filters follow the same concept but with independently programmable parameters. The parameter
`timeRange` determines the time window the filter is acting on. The parameter `matchCount` specifies how
many other events must fall into the chosen time window for the filter condition to act on the event at hand.
The parameter `inverse` inverts the filter action, i.e. when the filter would regularly have eliminated an event
it will then keep it instead and vice versa. For the typical case, let it be not inverted. Then, if `matchCount` is 1 we will
obtain a simple 'singles filter'. This is the most straight forward and most useful filter in typical quantum optics
experiments. It will suppress all events that do not have at least one coincident event within the chosen time
range. This can be in the same or any other channel.

In addition to the filter parameters explained so far it is possible to mark individual channels for use. Used
channels will take part in the filtering process. Unused channels will be suppressed altogether. Furthermore, it
is possible to indicate if a channel is to be passed through the filter unconditionally, whether it is marked as
`use` or not. The events on a channel that is marked neither as `use` nor as `pass` will not pass the filter, provided
the filter is enabled.

Note
----
    As outlined earlier, the Row Filters and Main Filter form a daisychain and the overall filtering result depends
    on their combined action. It is usually sufficient and easier to use the Main Filter alone. The only reasons for
    using the Row Filter(s) are early data reduction, so as to not overload the Main Filter, and the possible need
    for more complex filters, e.g. with different time ranges.

One important purpose of the event filters is to reduce USB load. When the input data rates are higher than the USB bandwith,
there will  be a FiFo overrun at some point. Under such conditions can be difficult to empirically optimize the filter settings.
Activating the filter test mode disables all data transfers into the FiFo so that a test measurement can be run without being interrupted
by a FiFo overrun. The library routines :meth:`getRowRates` and :meth:`getMainRates` can then be used to monitor the count rates
after the Row Filter and after the Main Filter. When the filtering effect is satisfactory the test mode can be switched off again
to perform the regular measurement.

    testMode: bool

# measurement classes
class Raw():
    """This is the `Raw` measurement class.

This class is made to directly access the TTTR (Time Tagged Time-Resolved) data. 
The format of the data depends on the :class:`.MeasMode` in the :meth:`snAPI.initDevice` function.

Each :obj:`.MeasMode.T2` event record consists of 32 bits. There are 6 bits for the channel number and 25 bits 
for the time tag. If the time tag overflows, a special overflow marker record is inserted in the
data stream, so that upon processing of the data stream a theoretically infinite time span can be
recovered at full resolution. 

Each :obj:`.MeasMode.T3` event record consists of 32 bits. There are 6 bits for the channel number, 15 bits
for the start stop time and 10 bits for the sync counter. If the counter overflows, a special
overflow marker record is inserted in the data stream, so that upon processing of the data stream
a theoretically infinite time span can be recovered. The 15 bits for the start stop time cover a
time span of 32768 times the chosen resolution. If the time difference between photon and the last
sync event is larger than this span the photon event cannot be recorded. This is the same as in
:obj:`.MeasMode.Histogram`, where the number of time bins is larger but also finite. However, by choosing a
suitable sync rate and a compatible resolution, it should be possible to reasonably accommodate
all relevant experiment scenarios. 

Note
----
    This class is provided primarily to enable compatibility with the native MHLib data formats. 
    It is recommended to use the :class:`Unfold` class instead, which allows much more convenient access to the data.

This function starts a block-wise data measurement. It refers to the practice of collecting, processing,
or transmitting data in discrete blocks or chunks, rather than as a continuous stream. Instead of receiving
all the data at once, the data is divided into manageable blocks, which are processed or analyzed one at a
time. This approach offers several benefits, such as efficient use of resources, real-time processing,
and the ability to handle data streams that are too large to process all at once.
The data is collected by the API until you capture it by the :meth:`getBlock` function.
The size of the block depends on the count rate and the time that reached until the next :meth:`getBlock` is executed. You also
have to set the size parameter to define the maximum size of the available block buffer. The data can be accessed with :meth:`getBlock`.

Warning
-------
    If the colleted data exceeds the maximum block size a warning will be added to the log: 
    'WRN RawStore buffer overrun - clearing!' and de internal buffer will be cleared. That

will block until the measurement is completed. If `waitFinished` is set `False` (default) you can get
updates on the fly, and you can request the execution status with the :meth:`isFinished` function.
If you wish to avoid blocking you can set `waitFinished` `False` and proceed with other code. Again, you
can check if the measurement is completed by using the :meth:`isFinished` function.
The data can be accessed with :meth:`getData`.

Caution

This function starts a block-wise data measurement. It refers to the practice of collecting, processing,
or transmitting data in discrete blocks or chunks, rather than as a continuous stream. Instead of receiving
all the data at once, the data is divided into manageable blocks, which are processed or analyzed one at a
time. This approach offers several benefits, such as efficient use of resources, real-time processing,
and the ability to handle data streams that are too large to process all at once.
The data is collected by the API internally until you retrieve it via the :meth:`getBlock` function.
The size of the block depends on the count rate and the time that elapsed until the next blockRead is executed.
Beforehand, you have to define the maximum size of the available block buffer. The data can be accessed with :meth:`getBlock`.

Warning
-------
    If the colleted data exceeds the maximum block size a warning will be added to the log: 
    'WRN UfStore buffer overrun - clearing!' and the internal buffer will be cleared. This
    means that this part of data is lost! To prevent this you should reduce the count rate!

Parameters
----------
    acqTime: int (default: 1s)
        | 0: means the measurement will run until :meth:`stopMeasure`
        | acquisition time [ms]
        | will be ignored if device is a FileDevice

and you can access the execution status with the :meth:`isFinished` function.
If you wish to obtain updates on the fly the data can be accessed with :meth:`getData`.

Note
----
    If you want to write the data to disc only, set the size to zero.

Warning
-------
    If the colleted data exceeds the buffer size a warning will be added to the log: 
    'WRN UfStore buffer overrun - clearing!' and the internal buffer will be cleared. This
    means that this part of data is lost! To prevent this, you should reduce the count rate.
    
Parameters
----------
    acqTime: int (default: 1s)
        | 0: means the measurement will run until :meth:`stopMeasure`
        | acquisition time [ms]
        | will be ignored if device is a FileDevice
    size: int number of records (default: 128 million records = 1GB)
        memory size for the data array
    waitFinished: bool (default: True)
        True: block execution until finished (will be False on acqTime = 0)
    savePTU: bool (default: False)
        Save data to ptu file

- :math:`k` is the index of the lag time in the sequence, with :math:`k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots, N-1`, where :math:`N` is the **numIntervals**
- :math:`p` is the period of the sequence, which is defined by **intervalLength** between successive powers of :math:`2`. \
For example, if :math:`\\tau_0 = 1` and :math:`p = 4`, then the sequence would include lag times of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, and so on.
- :math:`\\lfloor \\cdot \\rfloor` denotes the floor function, which rounds a number down to the nearest integer

Caution
-------
To calculate the histogram in :obj:`.MeasMode.T3` it is necessary to store `dTimes` (time difference
between the sync- and the channel events) in the internal unfold data stream, because the sync events
are removed. Therefore the herald manipulator only works in between to sync pulses. If you need the
default behaviour you have to use the :obj:`.MeasMode.T2` instead.
