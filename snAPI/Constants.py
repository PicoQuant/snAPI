The PicoQuant TCSPC devices support different measurement modes. 
The constants defined here are specified by the measurement mode with which the device gets initialized
when using :meth:`snAPI.initDevice<snAPI.Main.snAPI.initDevice>`.

In histogram mode, the photon arrival time data is instantly processed to calculate the time differences 
between sync events and events on the input channels. These then get accumulated in a set of histograms,
one for each input channel. This is typically used for classic fluorescence lifetime measurements
and requires very little data processing effort by the user. As opposed to this, the time tagging 
modes T2 and T3 are designed to stream the raw photon arrival time data to the host PC where the data then
can be processed and analyzed. This allows more flexibility to facilitate a huge range of more advanced applications.
Data processing can be carried out directly "on the fly" while the measurement is running. Alternatively the data 
can be streamed to a file or PC memory and be processed later. The snAPI library supports both approaches.


    """

**Histogram Mode**

For the measurement class :class:`.Histogram` it is useful to initialize the device in Histogram mode.
For devices that support hardware histogramming this will enable higher count rates than software processing
of the raw stream of time tags.

Note
----
    In histogram  mode no data is written to disc because the raw data stream is processed internally and
    does not get transmitted to the API.

    The T2 mode is PicoQuants time-tagging mode. In T2 mode, no periodic sync signal is required.
    The sync input can therefore be used to connect an additional photon detector. T2 mode is often
    used for any kind of coincidence detection, such as coincidence counting and correlation for,
    e.g., antibunching in a HBT set-up. Two pieces of information are collected for each event:
    
    • The elapsed time since the start of the measurement
    • The channel at which the event has been detected

**T3 Mode**

.. image:: _static/T3_mode.jpg

The T3 mode is an elegant solution for performing measurements at very high synchronization rates
and can provide more effective data encoding for many applications. This mode is ideally suited
for luminescence lifetime imaging and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. Three different pieces
of information are recorded for each detected event:

• The start-stop time difference (similar to classic  TCSPC)
• The number of elapsed sync pulses since measure ment start
• The channel at which the event has been detected
